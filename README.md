# Wind-Energy-Distribution-in-New-York-State
Optimized 5000 turbines' distribution in NY at Col. U

**Modeled in R.**

Implemented a large scale linear programming model to find the optimal geographical distribution of 5000 wind turbines in NY state which maximizes wind energy utilization considering a complex network of factors.
